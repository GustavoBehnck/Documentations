# Documentations

This repository contains Linux-based documentation that I have created throughout my life based on my needs.

It is available in both Portuguese (Brazil) and English.

> [!WARNING]
> Some basic English knowledge is required for the Portuguese section.

If you're looking for markdown examples, the file `md_examples.md` contains most of the markdown elements I use.

## Structure of the Documentation

I divide the documentation sections into folders. The repository's folder structure is as follows:

```
